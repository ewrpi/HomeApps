Hey! It's me, Eric. This is just my little IT / Development adventure.<br />It's a .NET Web Forms app hosted on a computer in my home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The primary function for users right now is just to browse my photo albums, but you can also download a game if you go to apps! Other than that, just go to the Home page and please leave a comment telling me who you are, why you're here, or whatever you'd like to say!</p>
